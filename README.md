## Fine-Tuning and Model Deployment

This repository implements the fine-tuning and model deployment process for the multi-agent system. Follow these steps to prepare and deploy your domain-specific models:

### Initialize Setup
- Ensure you have an active Azure OpenAI Service subscription with the necessary permissions to create and manage resources.
- Log in to the Azure portal and navigate to the OpenAI resource section.
- Create a new workspace or select an existing one to organize your training jobs, datasets, and model deployments.
- Set up access credentials (API keys, service principals) and securely store them for later integration.

### Prepare Data
- Gather domain-specific data relevant to your use case (e.g., customer support logs, technical documentation, chat transcripts).
- Clean the data by removing duplicates, correcting errors, and standardizing formats.
- Annotate or label the data if supervised learning is required.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust model evaluation and prevent overfitting.

### Fine-Tuning Process
- Choose a base model from Azure OpenAIâ€™s available options (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4, etc.) that best fits your domain and task complexity.
- Configure the fine-tuning job by specifying hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size.
- Upload your prepared dataset to the workspace and initiate the fine-tuning process.
- Monitor training metrics (loss, accuracy, etc.) in real-time, adjusting parameters as needed to optimize performance.
- Evaluate the model on the validation set after each epoch, and iterate on the process until the model meets your domain-specific benchmarks.

### Publish the Fine-Tuned Model
- Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, publish it as a managed endpoint using Azure OpenAI Service.
- Configure endpoint security, including authentication and authorization policies.
- Document the endpoint URL, required headers, authentication keys, and any usage quotas or rate limits.
- Record model performance metrics and versioning information for future reference and integration.
