# KnowledgeModel Implementation

## Overview

KnowledgeModel is a domain-specific, fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) designed for iterative learning and knowledge extraction. The system leverages Azure AI Foundry for deployment and provides specialized capabilities for processing and understanding domain-specific content.

## Architecture

The KnowledgeModel implementation consists of two primary components working in tandem to create a comprehensive learning pipeline:

### 1. Adaptive Summarization Pipeline
The first component focuses on knowledge extraction and training data generation:

- **Technology Stack**: Claude Sonnet 4 (via Anthropic API) for summarization, Azure Functions for serverless execution
- **Input Processing**: Reads text documents paragraph by paragraph from Azure Blob Storage
- **Output Generation**: Creates structured JSONL files containing prompt-response pairs
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Utilizes Claude Sonnet 4's advanced capabilities to extract key insights
- **Domain Context**: Incorporates domain-specific context for focused learning
- **Serverless Deployment**: Azure Functions with blob trigger for automatic processing

**Key Components:**
- `AbstractiveSummarizer.py`: Handles text summarization using Claude Sonnet 4
- `JsonlGenerator.py`: Generates training data in JSONL format using Azure OpenAI
- `Dataset.py`: Manages data loading and preprocessing
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless functions for automated text processing

### 2. Fine-Tuning Pipeline
The second component performs model customization and deployment:

- **Base Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 (via Azure OpenAI Service)
- **Training Data**: JSONL files generated from the summarization pipeline
- **Fine-Tuning Method**: Supervised fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets
- **Optimization**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques
- **Serverless Deployment**: Azure Functions for automated fine-tuning workflows

**Key Components:**
- `Model.py`: Custom model wrapper with training capabilities
- `Trainer.py`: Handles the fine-tuning process via Azure Machine Learning
- `Tokenizer.py`: Manages text tokenization and preprocessing
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless training orchestration and monitoring

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: Raw text documents containing domain-specific knowledge
2. **Preprocessing**: Text segmentation and cleaning
3. **Knowledge Extraction**: Summarization and insight generation
4. **Training Data Creation**: JSONL file generation with prompt-response pairs
5. **Model Fine-Tuning**: Supervised learning on generated datasets
6. **Deployment**: API deployment on Azure AI Foundry

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure
- **AI Services**: Azure AI Foundry, Azure OpenAI Service
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage for datasets and model artifacts
- **Authentication**: Azure Active Directory integration
- **Deployment**: RESTful API endpoints for model inference

## Configuration

The system uses a centralized configuration approach via `config.py`:
- Azure service endpoints and credentials
- Model parameters and hyperparameters
- Training configuration settings
- Deployment specifications

## Iterative Learning Capabilities

The KnowledgeModel is designed for continuous improvement through:
- **Incremental Training**: Addition of new domain knowledge without full retraining
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporation of user feedback and performance metrics
- **Domain Adaptation**: Fine-tuning for specific sub-domains or use cases
- **Knowledge Base Updates**: Regular updates with new source materials

## Deployment and API

The fine-tuned model is deployed as a scalable API service on Azure AI Foundry, providing:
- RESTful endpoints for model inference
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and monitoring
- Logging and analytics
- High availability and auto-scaling

## Benefits

- **Domain Expertise**: Specialized knowledge in target domains
- **Efficiency**: Reduced computational requirements compared to general-purpose models
- **Accuracy**: Higher precision for domain-specific tasks
- **Customization**: Tailored responses based on specific knowledge bases
- **Scalability**: Cloud-native deployment with Azure infrastructure
